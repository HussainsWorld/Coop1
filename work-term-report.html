            <p>
                Welcome to my co-op experience website! Here, I share the highlights of my first work term, including what I did, what I learned, and how it contributed to my professional development. I hope you find this overview insightful and reflective of the growth I experienced during this term.

            <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
            <img src="ORS Banner.png" alt="Office of Registrarial Services" class="img-fluid mb-3">
            <p>
                I was employed at the Registrar's Office which is located at the 3rd floor of the University Centre. I worked in the scheduling department under my supervisor Tammy, and worked with her to leverage my experience in computer science in ways I could be effective within my role. A major thing we discussed is the project of merging our databases from the Fall and Winter semesters.

        <!-- Goals -->
        <section id="goals" class="mt-5">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>My primary objectives were to strengthen my leadership, integrative communication, creative problem-solving, and time management abilities. I wanted to get better at taking initiative, thinking creatively when working on programming projects, expressing myself clearly, and efficiently managing my time so that I could balance work and personal obligations.</p>
            
            <p>Yes, I developed specific goals to enhance my communication and leadership while working on tasks like finding discrepancies in Excel spreadsheets. I also set goals to use creativity in my work by leveraging Python for tasks, even though it wasnâ€™t required. These goals were designed to directly benefit my job performance and contribute to the success of the team.</p>
            
            <p>My goal was to improve my communication abilities, especially concerning producing thorough and understandable documentation. I also wanted to become more of a leader by boldly taking the lead and offering suggestions. Technically speaking, I intended to use programming to simplify work and improve my inventiveness in problem-solving. Lastly, I concentrated on honing my time management skills, particularly in keeping a productive routine.</p>
            
            <p>I wanted to use technologies I would want to use in future jobs, such as different programming languages. To be specific, most of my work was done using Python and Java for data analysis and manipulation. My Java work assisted me in finding the correct instructor IDs by using JNDI API.</p>

        <!-- Job Description -->
        <section id="job-description" class="mt-5">
            <h2>Job Description</h2>
            
            <p>
                My role was titled Scheduling Support, and I performed a variety of programming, software development, and data analysis duties in my employment. Finding and fixing differences in instructor IDs between semesters, like the fall and winter terms, was one of the most fascinating assignments I worked on. I used the JNDI API and Java Apache POI to tackle this, which made it possible for me to effectively communicate with Excel files and directory services for LDAP lookups. I taught myself how to do the Java analysis on the job, however, concerning my data manipulation using Python and Pandas, that was something I learned previously through personal projects such as my Movie Recommendation System.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, this co-op experience was instrumental in shaping my professional skills and knowledge. I learned what it means to work as a part of a team and developed my proficiency in various technologies such as Python and Java while doing so. I will be here for the fall term and I'm excited to continue to learn more.

            <p>
                I would like to express my gratitude to Tammy, who provided invaluable support and guidance throughout my co-op term. Her understanding played a crucial role in my learning. Special thanks to her as well for allowing me to use her office as my own.
